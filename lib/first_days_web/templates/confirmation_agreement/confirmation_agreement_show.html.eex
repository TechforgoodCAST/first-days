        <p>Congratulations on recruiting your volunteer!</p>
        <p>An important part of building your volunteer relationship is a ensuring that there’s a clear understanding of what is expected from each party. This is particularly important when a private sector individual is working in the third sector for the first time.  It’s quite common for their to be differences in working culture that may surprise the volunteer.</p>
        <p>It’s good to get a signed agreement up front to help with this process.</p>
        <p>We’d recommend you personalise and send the agreement below to the volunteer as part of the confirmation process. We’ve also included some links that you might want to send through to them as they may help them prepare.</p>

        <p>Please copy the text below into a new document and edit it as you see fit before sending it to your volunteer.</p>


        <h3>Confirmation & Agreement (to edit and send to the volunteer)</h3>

        <p>Dear [NAME],</p>

        <p>We're delighted that you've agreed to volunteer with us.</p>
        <p>As part of the process we find it’s useful to set up a agreement between you and the organisation so that it’s clear what you can expect from us, and us from you.  We’ve created an non-legal honour bound agreement below. Please read this, and if you’re happy, sign it and send it back to us by [DATE]</p>
        <p>Linked to this, if you’ve not volunteered in third sector before, you might find some differences in working culture to other sectors.  To help you prepare for this, we’ve given you a few links that it may be useful for you to look at.</p>
        <p>[LINKS]</p>
        <p>We look forward to working with you.</p>
        <p>Many Thanks</p>
